# Infrastructure as Code(IaC)

Before the advent of IaC, infrastructure management was typically a manual and time-consuming process. System administrators and operations teams had to:

1. Manually Configure Servers: Servers and other infrastructure components were often set up and configured manually, which could lead to inconsistencies and errors.

2. Lack of Version Control: Infrastructure configurations were not typically version-controlled, making it difficult to track changes or revert to previous states.

3. Documentation Heavy: Organizations relied heavily on documentation to record the steps and configurations required for different infrastructure setups. This documentation could become outdated quickly.

4. Limited Automation: Automation was limited to basic scripting, often lacking the robustness and flexibility offered by modern IaC tools.

5. Slow Provisioning: Provisioning new resources or environments was a time-consuming process that involved multiple manual steps, leading to delays in project delivery.

IaC addresses these challenges by providing a systematic, automated, and code-driven approach to infrastructure management. Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager templates others. 

These tools enable organizations to define, deploy, and manage their infrastructure efficiently and consistently, making it easier to adapt to the dynamic needs of modern applications and services.
